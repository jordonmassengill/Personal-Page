        <h2>Music</h2>
        <p>My number one passion and favorite hobbies all include music. I listen to a lot of music and I mean A LOT! I have been practicing drums and guitar for years and use them both to make my own music in FLStudio. The list of music creating and recording equipment I have goes on and on but my favorite piece by far is my off white Fender Telecaster.</p>
        <p>I'm also quite the music collector. I own hundreds of albums, most of which are CDs, but I also have a large number of vinyls and cassette tapes. I enjoy cataloging them all on Discogs which you can see in the bottom navigation of this page!</p>
